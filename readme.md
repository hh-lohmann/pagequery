This is Mr Bertie's [pagequery plugin for DokuWiki](https://github.com/MrBertie/pagequery) with these additions / changes:

 * adding optional url parameter "pagequery" (GET or POST) for passing over QUERY, allowing dynamic calls (of preset pagequeries); to be honest: to (?mis-) use pagequery as an (occasional) replacement for DokuWiki's search
